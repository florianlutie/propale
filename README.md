# Propale WordPress Plugin

This repository contains the **Propale Manager** plugin. It provides a custom post type to manage commercial proposals directly from the WordPress admin.

## Installation

1. Copy the `wp-propale` folder into your WordPress `wp-content/plugins` directory.
2. Activate the "Propale Manager" plugin from the WordPress admin panel.

## Features

- Custom post type `propale` with editor support.
- Meta fields for video URL, status (draft, sent, accepted) and version.
- Basic admin interface for editing proposal details.

This is a minimal starting point for building a more advanced proposal management system.
